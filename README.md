# Enchanted-Wings-Marvels-Of-Butterfly-Species
This project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies butterfly species from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset containing images of 75 butterfly species. Users can upload an image through a simple Flask web interface, and the app predicts the species name.

Enchanted Wings is a deep learning-based butterfly species classifier using MobileNetV2. It predicts 75 species from images via a Flask web app, showing sample images and species info. Designed for education, research, and conservation, it makes butterfly identification simple and engaging.
